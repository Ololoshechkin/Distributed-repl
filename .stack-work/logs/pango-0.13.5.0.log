    (imported from Distribution.Simple.BuildPaths):
    Deprecated: "If you can, use 'autogenComponentModulesDir' instead, but if you really wanted package-global generated modules, use 'autogenPackageModulesDir'.  In Cabal 2.0, we avoid using autogenerated files which apply to all components, because the information you often want in these files, e.g., dependency information, is best specified per component, so that reconfiguring a different component (e.g., enabling tests) doesn't force the entire to be rebuilt.  'autogenPackageModulesDir' still provides a place to put files you want to apply to the entire package, but most users of 'autogenModulesDir' should seriously consider 'autogenComponentModulesDir' if you really wanted the module to apply to one component."
